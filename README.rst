lightpanel
==========

LightPanel is a simple Python program to display status of Jenkins builds on leds.

Requirements
------------

This project was build around WS2801 leds (``https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10504) and a Raspberry Pi (http://www.raspberrypi.org/).
It should be possible to adapt it for other hardware normally.

You'll need a few binaries installed:
  - mpg123 to play sounds
  - espeak for text notifications
  - nc to send data to Graphite
